Hi {{mutual_name}},

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to ask if you'd be open to making an intro to {{partner_name}} at {{investor_name}}.

We're building Donut Labs — an AI-powered crypto trading terminal with a browser agent, focused on Solana. {{thesis_connection}}

I think there could be a strong fit given {{investor_name}}'s focus on {{investor_thesis}}.

Happy to send over a quick blurb you can forward, or whatever format works best for you.

Thanks!
