Hi {{partner_name}},

{{opening_hook}}

I'm reaching out because {{thesis_connection}}.

We're building Donut — an AI-powered crypto trading terminal with a browser-native agent. Think of it as the intelligent layer between traders and the increasingly complex DeFi landscape, starting on Solana.

{{portfolio_reference}}

What makes us different:
- Browser-native AI agent that can understand and execute complex trading workflows
- MCP tool ecosystem that connects to any protocol or data source
- Built-in guardrails system to prevent costly mistakes

We're raising a pre-seed round ($2-3M) and would love to share more about what we're building. Would you have 20 minutes this week or next?

Best,
